   We fixed several bugs that are newly found after changing the compliler 
(from g77 to gfortran or g95). 

For "ipf.f", it is no more allowed to open the same file at the several different "open" file port.
So I changed writing/reading code, by spilitting all reading/writin points as a separate loop.

For "mccnp.f", there was one array exception, pointing out of boudary of the array in line 41. 
Line41   cf12 = sbar(iobj(i))  wrong code ---->>> cf12 = sbar(iobj(inobj))  correct code

For "main.f" npproc was defined as integer*8, but it was not consisten with other subroutine. I just changed it as integer.

 Fixed one bug in mccnp.f
 The s2, which is a distance between banch object and the current photon position, should be refreshed everytime when the position of photon changes.
Line 288- is rewritenn as follows
                  if(tsobj .eq. 1) then
                     call cones
     &                    (s12, x, y, z, ux, uy, uz, tobj12, face, io12)
                    call cones
     &                    (s2, x, y, z, ux, uy, uz, tobjb, face, io2)
                  else if(tsobj .eq. 2) then
                     call cyls
     &                    (s12, x, y, z, ux, uy, uz, tobj12, face, io12)
                    call  cyls
     &                    (s2, x, y, z, ux, uy, uz, tobjb, face, io2)
                  else if(tsobj .eq. 3) then
                     call elpss(s12, x ,y ,z ,ux ,uy ,uz ,tobj12, io12)
                     call elpss(s2, x ,y ,z ,ux ,uy ,uz ,tobjb, io2)
                  else if
The original was:
                  if(tsobj .eq. 1) then	
                     call cones	
     &                    (s12,x, y, z, ux, uy, uz, tobj12, face, io12)
                  else if(tsobj .eq. 2)    then
                     call cyls	
     &                    (s12, x, y, z, ux, uy, uz, tobj12, face, io12)
                  else if(tsobj .eq. 3) then
                     call elpss(s12, x ,y ,z ,ux ,uy ,uz ,tobj12, io12)
                  else if

mc1dtrace.f 

around line 107
ixr, iyr may become over knxr knyr (default=300).
The mimimun function was added.
ixr = min(ixr, knxr) 
iyr = min(iyr, knyr)

wdata.f
The quantum unit and energy unit were mixed up when computing the vertical fapar.
This was pointed out by Hideaki Kamiya, U of Tokyo
Previous line 86, 87: 
         app(k) = app(k) / (tflx * real(size * size))
         apnp(k) = apnp(k) * RQ * abs(cosq0) / real(np) / tflx

Corrected line 86, 87: 
         app(k) = app(k) / (tpfd * real(size * size))
         apnp(k) = apnp(k) * RQ * abs(cosq0) / real(np) / tpfd

rparam.f
For LAI calculation and gap fraction calculation modes.
The boundary condition was not set as periodic boundary, 
This was pointed out by Hideaki Kamiya, U of Tokyo

In rparam.f in line 611, 
I omit the bound=1 out of if((bound .ne. 1) .and. (bound .ne. 2))then

vegrad.f
To avoid zero-deivided, I added two lines after L77-82. 

 ga = ga + dlt(cb, 6) * 1.e-6
 ch = ch + dlt(cb, 6) * 1.e-6
