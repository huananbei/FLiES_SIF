# FLiES_SIF

FLiES (Forest Light Environmental Simulator) is a three dimensional plant canopy radiative transfer model that can compute reflectance, absorbed light, transmitted light in heterogeneous landscapes. By Hideki Kobayashi.

I expand this model can simulate the Solar-Induced Fluorescence (SIF).

Based on the FLiES version 2.48.
